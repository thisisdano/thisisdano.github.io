# Hello!
My name’s Dano and I’m a person on the internet. I’ve recently worked with Harvard’s [Library Innovation Lab](http://librarylab.law.harvard.edu/) and at the [Berkman Center for Internet and Society](https://berkman.harvard.edu/). I’m also the designer at [n+1](http://nplusonemag.com), a Brooklyn-based journal of literature and contemporary criticism.

See examples at [my portfolio](http://thisisdano.github.io/projects).
