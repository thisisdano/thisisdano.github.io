# Hello!
My name’s Dano and I’m a designer. I’ve recently worked with Harvard’s [Library Innovation Lab](http://librarylab.law.harvard.edu/) and at the [Berkman Center for Internet and Society](https://berkman.harvard.edu/). I’m also the designer at [n+1](http://nplusonemag.com), a Brooklyn-based journal of literature and contemporary criticism.

## More about my recent work.
It’s an amazing time to be a designer, right?

### Perma.cc
Link rot kills academic citations and Perma.cc kills link rot. It provides scholars and legal professionals unbreakable links to the digital sources cited in their work by creating permanent replacement web archives of those urls. I helped Harvard’s Library Innovation Lab take a hard look at Perma.cc from a usability perspective. We focused on making every element of the experience more consistent, reliable, and predictable. We looked at the typefaces, colors, and button shapes, but also at the words we use to describe and label the product and its parts. We built a trustworthy, bulletproof responsive design to take Perma.cc from a promising, popular beta to a polished 1.0 product.

### The Berkman Center for Internet and Society
The Berkman Center is the intellectual hub of the internet. They’d probably hate that hubristic hub-and-spoke analogy because of who they also are: humble and committed to openness, equality, and the promise of an open Web. (I’m sure they could explain why hub-and-spoke is problematic in great detail, but that doesn’t mean it isn’t so!) And this humble/hubris center-of-a-centerless-space paradox is the heart of The Berkman Center’s core challenge — to organize how they talk about *themselves* — their accomplishments, their many projects and fellows, and their organizational mission, with clarity, honesty, and focus. In other words, they needed a hierarchical structure to communicate their non-hierarchical structure. I helped The Berkman Center prioritize and organize their image of themselves. And we created an printed brochure that would help them talk about what makes the Center so special. In doing so, we helped lay the groundwork for a larger communication strategy.
