        is a university center based at Harvard University. Since 1997, the
        Center has studied the legal and sociopolitical impact of the Internet.
        It was developed to have an entrepreneurial focus and values active
        engagement with the Internet — projects and code rather than position
        papers and passive research. The strength of the Center is its network
        of fellows and associates who come to the Center not for compensation,
        but for the opportunity to learn from each other and pursue their
        individual and collaborative projects.
      </p>

      <h4 class="body">Project Objectives</h4>
      <p class="body">
        Create a printed prospectus to communicate the history and vitality of
        the Center to potential donors, fellows, and interested students. The
        attention-grabbing showpiece of this prospectus would be a visualization
        of the many important contributions the Center has made to the history
        of the Internet, told through the story of the Center’s 20 years of
        independent projects.
      </p>

      <h4 class="body">Initial Constraints</h4>
      <ul class="body">
        <li><strong>Material:</strong> Printed piece</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Limited data set:</strong> the only data common to every
          project was duration, description, and a rough taxonomy of type.
          Collecting additional data would be time consuming and its vetting
          could be problematic.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Institutional constraints:</strong> Non-hierarchy,
          even-handedness, fairness, modesty. Each project has its own
          stakeholders with their own objectives and priorities.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h4 class="body">The Center’s Vision</h4>
      <p class="body">
        The Center came to the project with the idea of presenting its projects
        as a network of subway lines (a transit graph), with three levels of
        representation: projects (stops); subject categories (lines); and
        pedagogic modes (geographic areas).
      </p>

      <h3 class="body"><strong>1: </strong>Discovery and story analysis</h3>
      <p class="body">
        I held a number of discussions with the communications team and also
        attended larger staff meetings to get a sense of the Center: its
        organizational culture, tone, decision-making process, and self image.
        It quickly became clear that the academic and research strengths of the
        Center — multiple autonomous teams with their own members and
        priorities, and a widely dispersed, collaborative, non-hierarchical
        organizational structure — made central decision making challenging. It
        was difficult for the Center to define a coherent idea of itself —
        almost every definition had caveats and exceptions. The Center was
        resistant to organizational self-definition as limited and limiting.
        Identity was an emergent property, only visible in the aggregate.
      </p>
      <p class="body">
        It felt important that the visualization make this aggregate identity
        explicit, and that what emerged could form a motif for the rest of the
        prospectus. I imagined the Center as something that you could only see
        through action and implication. Like negative space, or the concentric
        rings radiating from a stone dropped in water — the Center was both the
        stone and the rings, the literal center defined by its dynamic effect
        through time. Concentric rings, thus, are a natural indicator of time as
        well as dynamism. This was both a good story and a useful graph.
      </p>
      <p class="body">
        The Center’s initial transit graph metaphor had a few key weaknesses:
      </p>
      <ol class="body">
        <li>The transit graph metaphor is very strong and distinctive. Without a
          strong correlation between the data and transit, the metaphor can
          overwhelm and appear gimmicky.
        </li>
        <li>Our primary data were duration, and the transit graph doesn’t
          communicate duration as easily as taxonomy and sequence.
        </li>
        <li>The taxonomical data were pretty squishy. A transit graph is defined
          not only its lines but its intersections — how our projects were
          categorized would form the shape of the lines and intersections, and
          these relationships were subject to possibly endless discussion. The
          core structure should be something more objective.
        </li>
        <li>The transit graph carries the idea of sunk infrastructure — lines that
          are built and fixed in time. We needed to show that the Center is
          alive and growing.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p class="body">
        We agreed that we wanted our story to focus on the continued dynamism of
        the Center and how each project is both an example of that dynamism and
        a component of a larger dynamic. We agreed to proceed with a radial
        timeline, with projects shown as rays.
      </p>

      <h3 class="body"><strong>2: </strong>Initial Sketches</h3>
      <p class="body">
        Sketching revealed that the radial graph couldn’t have a strong
        background of its own. If it displayed with too much contrast, its
        circularity was a distraction, reading as a plate, record, or compact
        disc, self-contained rather than extending into the future.
      </p>

      <p class="body">
        Strong markers (i.e. dots) at the end of each project ray also added a
        level of complexity that might need to be explained. A strong marker at
        the beginning seemed clear enough as the indication of the start of a
        project, but did we need a distinction between a beginning marker and an
        end marker? What about projects that are ongoing? Would they have no end
        marker or a different kind? Markers at the beginning but not the end had
        the unpleasant effect of reversing the ray’s direction, evoking a sperm
        cell moving inward rather than energy radiating outward. The markers
        also began to define a cartesian field of their own that could
        potentially distract from the project rays. Markers provided a good
        anchor for a pointer, and an obvious focal point for the viewer, but
        their presence required balance.
      </p>
      <p class="body">
        It was going to be difficult to get all the projects and their content
        on the page and keep the focus clear.

      <h3 class="body">
        <strong>3: </strong>First pass, feedback, and refinement
      </h3>
      <p class="body">
        I was pleased with the first refined pass of the visualization. It had a
        good overall balance, the project subject and pedagogical modes were
        both clear and neither overwhelmed the other. We had a consistent
        treatment for markers (white on the start side and filled with the
        subject color on the end side). The overall piece had what you might
        call “sparkle” or inviting contrast. The visualization motif also worked
        well as a cover motif, abstract but energetic and evocative.

      <p class="body">
        The first round of feedback revealed some weaknesses in the
        visualization and a clarification of the Center’s institutional
        priorities.
      </p>
      <p class="body">
        The two levels of categorization (subject and pedagogic mode) were
        causing internal anxiety at the Center over their definition and
        application. They could not agree on each project’s subject
        categorization and decided that the subject level would have to be
        scrapped. While this allowed us to minimize or remove the mode indicator
        in the background color, it also meant losing a key project
        differentiator: the color in the project name. Since projects could
        exist in different modes, a single color couldn’t easily represent
        multiple modes. Blended colors (green as a mix of yellow and blue) were
        not only ambiguous, but made the visualization look like a rainbow and
        felt juvenile. A multicolor title wasn’t a good option.
      </p>
      <p class="body">
        The Center decided that each project needed to have a description, and
        none of them would include milestones. While there was a visual benefit
        to different levels of project treatment, as well as limited space for
        additional text, it was critically important to the Center that each
        project be treated similarly. Favoritism, even at the level of visual
        distinction, was going to be a political problem. I would need to get
        more copy on the visualization, make the projects similar, and provide
        contrast in another way.
      </p>
      <p class="body">
        Continuing projects were also a problem. They weren’t reading clearly,
        and there was an ambiguity between continuing projects (those that
        extended to the circumference of the disc) and the label pointers (the
        dotted lines that connected a project name/description to a ray). The
        pointers looked more like continuations because they extended past the
        circumference of the disc.
      </p>
      <p class="body">
        And finally, the Center needed to include a small piece of explanatory
        text somewhere on the image to explain the context of the pedagogical
        modes.
      </p>
      <p class="body">
        This feedback introduced a few major new constraints and content
        elements, the effect of which could be to flatten the contrast of the
        piece and reduce it to a cloud of text. Back to the drawing board.
      </p>

      <h3 class="body">
        <strong>4: </strong>Second pass (flexibility and rigidity)
      </h3>
      <p class="body">
        We needed to get a lot more text on the page and present each project
        with less individual distinction. Neither of these new constraints were
        negotiable.
      </p>
      <p class="body">
        On the bright side, the visualization told the story well, and the motif
        successfully unified the entire prospectus. I needed to strengthen the
        motif and establish visual hierarchy through other means. If the concept
        of the visualization could influence the direction of the cover motif,
        could the direction of the cover motif feed back and influence the
        visualization?
      </p>
      <p class="body">
        Part of the cover’s strength comes from its simplicity — the strength of
        the rays against an empty background. I could apply this to the
        visualization by thickening the project rays and reducing the visual
        weight of the background graph. This solved a number of the new
        constraints by strengthening the motif, removing the ambiguity of the
        markers, and allowing continuing projects to extend beyond the
        circumference of the graph — a clearer indication of their continued
        activity.
      </p>
      <p class="body">
        My experience in book design indicated that it would be possible to
        print the visualization graph as rich black on 100%K black. The rays
        could be solid lines for single pedagogic modes, and alternating square
        dashes for multiple modes. Every project, then, would be a single ray
        with a similar treatment. Trial and error revealed a suite of colors
        that worked well both as single colors and alternating combinations. We
        also had the opportunity to add new patterns for periods of project
        hiatus (a thin dotted line) and for instances when the project spun off
        from the Center (a wide-dashed white-to-rich-black gradient line that
        extended outside the graph to the edge of the page).
      </p>
      <p class="body">
        The new ray treatment had great energy. Now I could contrast the strong
        diagonals of the rays with a rigid grid of project text. This difference
        in structure could provide the balance the piece needed. The final touch
        was the “service ribbon,” a thin line with the same mode pattern as the
        project ray that appears next to the project name and description to
        connect it visually to the project ray and allow a faster read of the
        project’s mode.
      </p>

      <p class="body">
        This treatment got great feedback from the Center, so it was off to
        print!
      </p>

      <h3 class="body"><strong>5: </strong>Adapting to print</h3>
      <p class="body">
        When the first proofs returned form the printer, everything looked
        beautiful — <em>except</em> that the gridlines completely vanished and
        the project descriptions were printing with a nearly unreadable line
        screen! Clearly, this wasn’t acceptable.
      </p>
      <p class="body">
        Further discussion with the printer revealed that the black-on-black
        printing wasn’t going to work, despite my experience otherwise. But it
        is rarely in your favor to go against your printer’s recommendations —
        having a representative on your side at the printer who believes in the
        project and knows how to make it perform at its best is more important
        than almost any other consideration. The Center didn’t have the budget
        to perform the battery of press tests required to be certain. The
        printer suggested not only changing the gridlines to gray, but
        increasing their weight, and also lightening the color of the project
        descriptions.
      </p>
      <p class="body">
        Thus I found myself in a situation not unlike that of Jørgon Leth in his
        <cite>The Five Obstructions</cite>, where Leth is tasked with directing
        a simple story while a sadistic Lars von Trier adds increasingly strange
        and challenging structural restrictions!
      </p>
      <p class="body">
        At this point, though, it was important to trust the printer and trust
        that I could make the final balance work. In the end, after following
        the printer’s guidelines and balancing the relative weights of the
        gridlines, rays, and descriptions, it hit the press and worked!
      </p>

      <h3 class="body"><strong>6: </strong>Conclusion</h3>
      <p class="body">
        Design often comes down to balance — visual balance, of course, but also
        a balance between expectations and practicalities, and the complete
        matrix of strengths and weaknesses that determines the overall shape of
        design. Design thinking doesn’t set out to make everyone happy, rather
        to strike the best balance between the needs of each class of
        stakeholder — client, user, and fabricator. While the user is the most
        important of the three, the constraints set by the other two can’t be
        ignored. There can be disagreements along the way, but the most
        important through line is a story that makes sense to the client,
        appeals to a user, and can be built by a fabricator. In the case of the
        Berkman Center, their dynamic history suggested the shape of a story
        that’s only gotten stronger when faced with multiple, overlapping
        constraints.
      </p>
      <p class="body">That’s a success story.</p>
